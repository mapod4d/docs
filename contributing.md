## Reporting bugs

The golden rule is to **always open *one* issue for *one* bug**. If you notice
several bugs and want to report them, make sure to create one new issue for
each of them.

## Contributing pull requests

First of all check to propose an improvement useful to everyone.

Follow this rules:
- do a fork of repository, better the just branch master
- (opzional) protect your branch in the fork
- locally do git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/docs
- work locally with git
- fetch your remote and locally master from upstream mapod4d/docs master
- send push to yuor remote master
- when you think it is useful, make a pull request from your remote to the master branch of mapod4d/docs
